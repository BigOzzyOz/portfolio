## Project Description

This portfolio demonstrates my full-stack web development skills through a diverse range of projects. It includes the development of interactive web applications such as a Kanban board and a Slack clone, as well as a 2D game. The main technologies used are Angular, TypeScript, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Python with Django and Firebase for the backend.
This portfolio includes the following projects:

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BigOzzyOz/portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd portfolio`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
